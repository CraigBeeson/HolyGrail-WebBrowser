# HolyGrail-WebBrowser v0.3.1
A customizeable browser written in python using PyQt5.
# Details
This project is a web browser created using PyQt5 with python.
The browser is very basic before enabling plug-ins(Still is anyways).
The goal of this project is to use plug-ins for the different features of the browser,
since plug-ins can be enabled/disabled this means more plug-ins equals more customizability.
To launch the browser run the "holygrail-webbrowser.py" file.
Tensorflow wasn't available in python 3.12 when I made this.
May have to do 'pip install tf-keras' to use the legacy keras for the model.
