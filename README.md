# HolyGrail-WebBrowser v0.3.1
A customizeable browser written in python using PyQt5.
# Details
This project is a web browser created using PyQt5 with python.
So you will need to install PyQt5, the best way to do this is to do "pip install pyqt5" and "pip install pyqtwebengine".
Other packages for some plugins include "pandas", "matplotlib", "keras"
The browser is very basic before enabling plug-ins(Still is anyways).
The goal of this project is to use plug-ins for the different features of the browser,
since plug-ins can be enabled/disabled this means more plug-ins equals more customizability.
To launch the browser run the "holygrail-webbrowser.py" file.
The currently pointless "Request Monitor" plugin requires the application to be ran with python 3.11 or earlier
