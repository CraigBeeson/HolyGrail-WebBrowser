So you will need to install PyQt5, the best way to do this is to do "pip install pyqt5".
The browser is very basic before enabling plug-ins.
The goal of this project is to use plug-ins for the different features of the browser,
since plug-ins can be enabled/disabled this means more plug-ins equals more customizability.
